The rocker-bogie system is the suspension arrangement developed in late 90s by NASA for their Mars rovers. The rocker-bogie design has no springs or stub axles for each wheel, allowing the rover to climb over obstacles (such as rocks) that are up to twice the wheel's diameter in size while keeping all six wheels on the ground.The system is designed to be used at slow speed.

## Working
In order to go over a vertical obstacle face, the front wheels are forced against the obstacle by the center and rear wheels. The rotation of the front wheel then lifts the front of the vehicle up and over the obstacle. The middle wheel is then pressed against the obstacle by the rear wheels and pulled against the obstacle by the front until it is lifted up and over. Finally, the rear wheel is pulled over the obstacle by the front two wheels. During each wheel's traversal of the obstacle, forward progress of the vehicle is slowed or completely halted.

Rocker Bogie systems are ideal low cost candidates for stair climbing purpose. You do not need super complex algorithms and sophisticated hardware parts. The problem is that they should be carefully designed according to the run and rise of a staircase (Although staircases will have a standardized run and raise).
